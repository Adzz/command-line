MV 

As in MOVE

Like Jagger. Can you guess what it does? (It moves)

format:

mv [switch(s)] [file to be moved] [destination] 

Also effectively renames things, because they are sort of the same thing.

Important switches: 

-b = Backup backup coz it's on. 
      makes backup of each file that would be overwritten or removed
      
-f = Force

-i = Interactive
      prompts prompt and more prompts

-S = Suffix
      append a marker to the files made fom the b switch.

-v = Verbose

-n = don't overwrite
